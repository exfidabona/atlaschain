# The P2P Marketplace Project


P2P Marketplace(P2PMP) is A blockchain framework for building competitive marketplaces built on top of Quorum(https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum).

The idea behind the framework is to create a plug and play environment for entrepreneurs to create digital marketplaces that are driven by their own customized cryptocurrency. This framework would be analagous to what wordpress was for blogs.

Goals & Enhancements:

  * __Adapt Governance__ - Quorum is built for financial institutions. We want to adapt their model of governance and privacy for digital marketplaces. We want to keep permissions, but optimize them for open competition.
  * __Proof of Merit__ - Create a new BFT algorithm modeled after dBFT to be optimized for digital asset authentication and delegate reputation
  * __Marketplace Business Logic__ - Similar to Quorum extending consensus to genesis contracts, we want to make marketplace business logic work out of the box and also be customizable
  * __Add Customizable Token Incentive__ - Also using a genesis defined smart contract we want to let users create and customize their own mineable cryptocurrency
