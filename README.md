# The AtlasChain Project


AtlasChain is a blockchain framework for building digital marketplaces. We are building upon the work done by the team at Quorum(https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum) to build a specialized blockchain designed to authenticate and facilitate the direct buying and selling of information based assets.

__Our hypothesis is that blockchain technologies will do for digital marketplaces what the internet revolution did for blogging. Therefore, AtlasChain is analagous a blockchain version of wordpress__.

Necessary Enhancements to Quorum:


  * __Reputation Based Consensus__ - Build a reputation system smart contract that drives a RAFT peer-to-peer network consensus algorithm
  * __Digital Asset Proofing__ - Create a plugin system for proofing different kinds of digital assets
  * __Add Customizable incentive__ - The Quorum project removed ether gas and incentives from transactions and block creation. We want to allow the optional install of a smart contract based liquid token that can replace it.
