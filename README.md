# The P2P Marketplace Project


P2P Marketplace(P2PMP) is A blockchain framework for building competitive marketplaces built on top of Quorum(https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum).

The idea behind the framework is to create a plug and play environment for entrepreneurs to create marketplaces tha directly buy and sell information assets using a customized cryptocurrency.__Our hypothesis is that blockchain technologies will do for digital marketplaces what the internet revolution did for blogging. Therefore, The P2P Marketplace Project is analagous to the blockchain version of wordpress__.

Necessary Enhancements to Quorum:


  * __Reputation Based Consensus__ - Build a reputation system smart contract that drives a RAFT peer-to-peer network consensus algorithm
  * __Digital Asset Proofing__ - Create a plugin system for proofing different kinds of digital assets
  * __Add Customizable incentive__ - The Quorum project removed ether gas and incentives from transactions and block creation. We want to allow the optional install of a smart contract based liquid token that can replace it.
